Calculator Program
The program consists of two classes:

Calculator class:

This class contains the calc method that performs the calculation based on the provided numbers and operator.
The method uses a switch statement to select the appropriate operation and calculates the result.
If the division operator is selected, it checks for division by zero and handles the error accordingly.
Program1 class:

This class contains the main method and is the entry point of the program.
It creates an instance of the Calculator class and takes user input for two numbers and the operator.
It then calls the calc method of the Calculator class to perform the calculation and display the result.
Odd Numbers Program
The program consists of a single class:

Program2 class:
This class contains the main method and is the entry point of the program.
It takes user input for a number using the Scanner class.
The program then iterates from 1 to (n*2)-1, where n is the input number.
For each iteration, it checks if the current number is odd (i%2!=0), and if so, it prints the number.
Odd Numbers Program
The program consists of a single class:

Program3 class:
This class contains the main method and is the entry point of the program.
It takes user input for a number using the Scanner class.
The program then calculates a value, val, based on the input number. If the number is odd, val is set to the input number; otherwise, it is set to the input number minus 1.
The program then iterates from 0 to (val*2)-1.
For each iteration, it checks if the current number is odd (i%2!=0), and if so, it prints the number.
Multiples Count Program
The program consists of a single class:

Program4 class:
This class contains the main method and is the entry point of the program.
It takes user input for the size of the array using the Scanner class.
It then takes input for the elements of the array using a loop and stores them in the array ar.
It defines an array multiple containing the numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] to check for multiples.
The program uses a HashMap called countMap to store the count of multiples.
It initializes the count map with multiples and default count as 0.
It iterates through the array and counts the multiples for each number using nested loops and updates the count in the countMap.
Finally, it prints the count map with the multiples and their corresponding counts.
